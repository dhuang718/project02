# Analyzing 10Gb of Yelp Reviews Data

For this project, I will use pyspark to analyze 10gb of Yelp data, including the following tables: business , review, and user. I will be using a python notebook with a pyspark kernel to conduct my analysis and show my understanding of utilizing Apache Spark technology. This project was done with AWS S3 to simulate a real world data lake storage and AWS EMR for big data analytics.
